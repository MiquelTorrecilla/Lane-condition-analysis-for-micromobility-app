# Lane-condition-analysis-for-micromobility-applications

Due to the increase in population in large urban areas, mobility in large cities has become increasingly problematic and difficult. With the desire to find solutions to this situation, the use of micro-mobility vehicles has become popular.

In this sense the solution presented proposes to make use of Deep Learning and Computer Vision techniques in order to identify, automatically, possible defects where micro-mobility vehicles circulate, in order to alert authorities and other users and improve user safety.

Three solutions were devised to determine which one best suited the needs of the project. The first two to test the two models separately and the third one with the intention of combining them, with ensemble learning techniques, to try to improve the results obtained.
